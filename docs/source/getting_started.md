# Getting Started

## Step by step

A general Tierkeis graph allows us to specify:-

- inputs to the entire graph
- custom task definitions (Tierkreis 'workers')
- a way to store and share inputs and outputs (the 'storage' interface)
- a way to run tasks (the 'executor' interface)

For our first graph we make the following simplifications: the graph has no inputs and uses only the built-in task definitions that come with the Tierkreis library.
